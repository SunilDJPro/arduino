#I made this project for one of my friend who got stuck with mini-project for his sem. As said it's a mini intermediate project but can also be used as a tool too!

#Follow the circuit diagram for assembly, Code framed to be used with UNO, can be modified for Nano and any other boards. 
#Make sure to install I2C_LCD library from library manager under tools section of IDE.

#THIS CIRCUIT CAN ONLY HANDLE 1-30 VOLTS OF DC! DO NOT TRY TO MEASURE ANYTHING HIGHER THAN 30V. (We use inbuilt ADC of arduino to make out the values, doing so can directly damage the entire cicuit leaving nothing!)
#Try Measuring Voltages with AA/AAA cells, 9V Batteries, 3V cells, etc.
