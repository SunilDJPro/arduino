Hello!

This Project focuses on keeping you productive towards your end goals!
Recent researches have shown that having certain time limits and breaks during our work/study/productive sessions increases the endurance, rate of achieving and minimizes the chances of procastination.

Many people especially in research background face these issues as we may not get enough rewards for the time we spend, So by having a restricted timing for continous work and have a little breaks in between will
encourage us to work effeciently with full concentration and dedication.

THIS PROJECT IS MODIFIED TO WORK ONLY ON ARDUINO UNO R4 WIFI EDITION WHICH HAS 96 LEDs MATRIX DISPLAY. KINDLY MODIFY TO YOUR REQUIREMENTS BEFORE UPLOADING!
THIS PROJECT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH 8 BIT MCU BOARDS! WILL CAUSE MEMORY OVERFLOW DURING UPLOAD AND MISBEHAVE (RUNTIME PROBLEM). 
Suggested Boards are any 32bit MCU such as ESP32(RISC-V),STM32,RP2040,etc.
